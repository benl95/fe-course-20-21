## Practicum

In this lesson you will refresh your knowledge of Front-end, find out how Front-end is scoped within Block-tech, do some exercises and get insight into the FED2 program. You will also create a folder structure for the job story that you designed in the Project Tech course - this will become your Front-end feature, which you will be graded on.

Key takeaways;
- You have 1 repo for block tech
- Front-end code will live in your /public folder which exists in your static folder (/static/public/html | /static/public/js | /static/public/css)
- Progressive Enhancement
- Datatypes
