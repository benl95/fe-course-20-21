## Description

In Frontend 2 we concentrate on improving the knowledge core JavaScript concepts and learn how to [progressively enhance][pe] interfaces with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. In so called Dev-❤️-Devs sessions (based on a method developed by [De Voorhoede][voorhoede]) multiple frontend components are designed and build.

Frontend 2 is an elective course given in Quarter 3 & 4 after the core curriculum of our programme, building further on knowledge acquired in Internetstandaarden, Inleiding Programmeren, and Frontend 1. This course is chosen alongside Backend and Project Tech, together making up Block Tech. In Project Tech you’ll apply your newfound frontend skills.

If you’d like to continue with web development after this course, do a tech internship next quarter (Q4), choose Information Design (includes Frontend Apps, Functional Programming, and Frontend Data) for the fall semester next year, and pick Minor Everything Web in the spring semester after that.
